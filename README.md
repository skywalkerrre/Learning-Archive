## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🔹 Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp

* Comprehensive exercise set from the **Udemy “Complete Python 3 Bootcamp”**.
* ✅ Completed **all exercises**, from basic syntax to advanced concepts (OOP, decorators, error handling, data structures).
* Strengthened foundations in **clean coding, modular design, and practical Python problem-solving**.
* Demonstrates **consistency, discipline, and end-to-end completion of a structured curriculum**.

### 🔹 Ivy (Harvard-Inspired Project)

* Analyzed and forked a complex open-source codebase as part of a **\$50 paid task**.
* Objective: research how to **merge multiple Python AI frameworks under a unified umbrella**.
* Result: significantly enhanced my understanding of **AI ecosystem interoperability**, framework-level design decisions, and cross-framework abstractions.
* Directly contributed to my **research interest in intelligent system integration and framework unification**.

### 🔹 Shopping-List

* A Python application implementing **CRUD operations, persistent storage, and user interaction**.
* Focused on applying **software engineering principles** like modularity, maintainability, and usability.
* Demonstrates my ability to turn **small-scale ideas into functioning, user-friendly tools**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* **Academic Focus:**
  Showcase a mix of **structured learning (Bootcamp)**, **applied research exposure (Ivy)**, and **hands-on implementation (Shopping-List)** to demonstrate readiness for **graduate-level study in AI and software systems**.

* **Industry Relevance:**
  Highlight **clean code practices**, **problem-solving mindset**, and the ability to **work with real-world codebases and build practical tools**.

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

* Expand repository with:

  * ✅ **Machine learning experiments** (scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.)
  * ✅ **Data engineering pipelines**
  * ✅ **Testing frameworks + CI/CD integration**
* Refactor selected projects into **production-grade applications**.
* Document learnings in a **personal wiki** within the repo for future reference.
