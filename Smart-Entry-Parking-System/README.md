## 📑 Repository Description

The Smart-Entry-Parking-System is an IoT-based project that integrates RFID authentication, servo motor control, and Arduino Uno programming to automate secure vehicle entry and exit in a parking environment.

Using an RFID reader (MFRC522), the system authenticates registered cards to grant access by opening the gate barrier (servo motor). Unauthorized users are denied access, while guests can gain entry via Bluetooth-triggered commands. This project showcases embedded system design, hardware-software integration, and practical automation in smart city infrastructure.

This project strengthened my skills in microcontroller programming, hardware interfacing, and IoT-based security systems.

## 📂 Project Overview

✅ Integrated RFID authentication for secure user identification.

✅ Configured Arduino Uno to validate RFID tags against pre-registered IDs.

⚡ Automated servo motor gate control based on access authorization.

📡 Added Bluetooth entry mechanism for guest users.

📺 Real-time UID display via Serial Monitor for debugging and logging.
