## 📂 Repository Description

The Cybersecurity Reconnaissance Tools project is a Python-based toolkit focused on remote OS discovery and reconnaissance activities.
Traditional methods for identifying remote host operating systems often rely on manual intervention or direct access, leading to accuracy and security limitations.

This repository introduces an automated, accurate, and efficient solution for identifying remote operating systems without direct host access. It is designed to:

Minimize false positives/negatives

Offer real-time insights

Strengthen defense mechanisms

Enhance threat intelligence gathering

## 📌 Project Overview

✅ Automated remote OS discovery without direct access.
✅ Reduction of false positives and negatives in detection.
⚡ Integration with SQLite database (portmap.db) for mapping and storing reconnaissance results.
📝 Modular Python code for easy extension and security research.
📊 Focused on real-time reconnaissance and cyber defense strengthening.
